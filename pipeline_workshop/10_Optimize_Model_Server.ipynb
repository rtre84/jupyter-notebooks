    "### CPU-only\n",
    "If your system is CPU-only (no GPU), then consider the following values: \n",
    "* `num_batch_threads` equal to the number of CPU cores\n",
    "* `max_batch_size` to infinity (ie. MAX_INT)\n",
    "* `batch_timeout_micros` to 0. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then experiment with batch_timeout_micros values in the 1-10 millisecond (1000-10000 microsecond) range, while keeping in mind that 0 may be the optimal value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPU\n",
    "\n",
    "If your model uses a GPU device for part or all of your its inference work, consider the following value:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `num_batch_threads` to the number of CPU cores.\n",
    "* `batch_timeout_micros` to infinity while tuning `max_batch_size` to achieve the desired balance between throughput and average latency. Consider values in the hundreds or thousands.\n",
    "\n",
    "For online serving, tune `batch_timeout_micros` to rein in tail latency. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that batches normally get filled to max_batch_size, but occasionally when there is a lapse in incoming requests, to avoid introducing a latency spike it makes sense to process whatever's in the queue even if it represents an underfull batch. \n",
    "\n",
    "The best value for `batch_timeout_micros` is typically a few milliseconds, and depends on your context and goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Zero is a value to consider as it works well for some workloads.  For bulk-processing batch jobs, choose a large value, perhaps a few seconds, to ensure good throughput but not wait too long for the final (and likely underfull) batch."
